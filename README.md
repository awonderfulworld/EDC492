## iSTEM Education Through Digital Stories
### Repository for EDC492 files
This repository is to collect files that are relevant to the EDC492 unit taken to attain a Bachelor of Education (primary) degree at Curtin University.

# Assessment One (due 12/07/2019 23:59AWST)
## Brief
We are to find a social issue topic that STEM can provide a solution for and create a 3-5 minute long digital story that tells the viewer of the problem and how STEM can offer a solution. The story is to be told and animated using the Scratch programming language[3,4].

The 8 Step Digital Storytelling Process (see images folder) is to be followed. Due to time and course restrictions only limited feedback could be collected. Most input for the development of the story came from reflection.


## File Structure
* Scratch Code 
* Images
* Video
* Other

### Scratch Code 
These files are created by Scratch. They can be used for backup or offline development. The later is discouraged if the goal is to have the project hosted on https://scratch.mit.edu as there are different issues with code and assets that can arise which are hard to track down if developed offline. Online development provides frequent feedback if a project can be stored or not, narrowing down the code where the issue might be.

#### Scratch Online Project Storage Issues
Issues found are not limited but include the below.
* using vector images not produced by Scratch
* using sound files (keep them short and in wav format to minimise issues)
* any files edited by the Scratch editors (avoid Scratch's editors as much as possible; do not use the sound editor; if you turn a bitmap into a vector image, make sure to revert it back to a bitmap)

### Images
This is a collection of all the images that are in the public domain only. File formats found are gif, jpg, png, and svg.

### Videos
This folder contains a collection of screen-capture-videos recorded to demonstrate the project's different story lines and hidden features.

### Other
These are related files that do not fit into any of the other folders.


## Regarding Licensing
### Project Code
All Scratch code produced is copylefted, meaning it is in the public domain and can be freely used without restrictions.

### Project Assets
Most assets are in the public domain, a few use a CC license permitting their use in this project, but there are other images that do not have a freedom license or where the copyright is unclear. I recommend that you get in touch with me regarding assets you would like to reuse to clarify the status of the asset.

#### Use of Copyrighted Material
As this project is for a unit at an Australian university Australian law is applicable.

Australian copyright law has a Fair Dealing provision, an explanation of which can be found on the Australian Copyright Council Website[1]. In that document it states that "[t]he fair dealing exceptions are relevant when you are using copyright material in one of the exclusive ways reserved for the copyright owner" and "you are using the whole or a substantial part of the material."

The document explains that "[t]he Copyright Act allows you to use copyright material without permission if your use is a “fair dealing” for one of the following purposes," then listing "research or study" as an exempted purpose. Hence, this project is allowed to use copyrighted material. But this is for this project alone. Copyrighted materials may not be used in cloned or other projects unless permitted under local law or permission from the copyright holder is gained.

Further information can be gained by visiting the Australian Copyright Agency's website[2].

#### Public Domain Images
Most photos used are sourced from https://unsplash.com, a site dedicated to hosting photos released into the public domain. While no credit needs to be provided with images in the public domain, every image has been listed in the Image References List, which can be found in the Other (files) folder.

#### Flickr Images
Flickr allows users to attach a license to their hosted images and provides an interface to search for images that come with a Creative Commons license. With one exception (the picture of a naked plastic bottle) all images have some sort of CC license. Note that these are and can be restrictive, so play close attention.

#### Collages
Images created with multiple images may have different licenses attached to them. I will update this as soon as I get to verifying which licenses the images I put into collages fall under.

#### My Images
The current version of the project only has one photo of mine. It is released into the public domain (a photo of the ocean taken from a plane on my way to Bohol, Philippines).

All other images (sprites, "covers," "stickers," and backdrops) are also released into the public domain. While attribution is appreciated it is no a requirement. Everything is copyleft, so do as you please. Reuse, remix, sell it, what ever makes you happy.

#### Audio Files
All voice recordings are of me speaking. These are released into the public domain.

All other audio files are sourced from the audio library of Scratch.

#### Video Files
The footage used for The Story of Boyan sub-story can be found on The Clean Ocean web site in the media gallery[5].

All video screen-capture-recordings found in the video folder are released into the public domain.
